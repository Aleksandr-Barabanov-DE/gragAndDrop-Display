## Project Description

Product Showcase is a simple web application for visually displaying products with the option to drag items into a cart. Users can select products, move them to the cart, and view the cart’s updated contents. This project can serve as a foundation for creating more complex interfaces for online stores or product-based applications.

## Features

- **Drag-and-drop**: Supports product dragging into the cart with both mouse and touch interactions.
- **Various animations** for each product displayed on the showcase.
- **Cart addition effects**: Products change appearance and disappear from the showcase when added to the cart.
- **Product quantity check**: Once a certain quantity of items (e.g., 3) is added, a button appears to proceed to checkout.
- **Responsive design**: The project is optimized for both mobile and desktop use.
